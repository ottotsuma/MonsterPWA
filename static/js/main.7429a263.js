It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.","The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools; a wizard might study at the School of Illusion while another studies across town at the School of Enchantment. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques."],"School of Evocation":{content:"You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid.

You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.","For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it.

This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.","If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.","***The Book\u2019s Appearance.*** Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes.

The box clamps together, and one side can be used as a cooking pan and the other as a plate or shallow bowl.","***Oil.*** Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. As an action, you can splash the oil in this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.","***Poison, Basic.*** You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying.","***Potion of Healing.*** A character who drinks the magical red fluid in this vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit points.

A compartmentalized pouch for holding spell components is called a component pouch (described earlier in this section). Quiver. A quiver can hold up to 20 arrows. Ram, Portable. You can use a portable ram to break down doors. When doing so, you gain a +4 bonus on the Strength check. One other character can help you use the ram, giving you advantage on this check.","***Rations.*** Rations consist of dry foods suitable for extended travel, including jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, and nuts.","***Rope.*** Rope, whether made of hemp or silk, has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DC 17 Strength check.","***Scale, Merchant\u2019s.*** A scale includes a small balance, pans, and a suitable assortment of weights up to 2 pounds.

When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.","If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don\u2019t roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.","If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.","When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the halfling\u2019s Lucky trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a halfling has advantage or disadvantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1.","You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration can also give a character advantage. The","GM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result."]},"Proficiency Bonus":{content:["Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by level. Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.","Your proficiency bonus can\u2019t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the save.","Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. For example, the rogue\u2019s Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.","By the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn\u2019t normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don\u2019t add the bonus to the check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0.

This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal\u2014 for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.","Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding.","If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the door remains shut."]},Skills:{content:["Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual\u2019s proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect.

Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding.","The skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list.

In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.","For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the GM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check.

Proficiency in Athletics, for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the GM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your GM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your GM might call for a Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your GM might allow you to apply your proficiency in Athletics and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check. So if you\u2019re proficient in Athletics, you apply your proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, when your half-orc barbarian uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your GM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though Intimidation is normally associated with Charisma."},"Passive Checks":{content:["A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn\u2019t involve any die rolls.

In combat, this requires the Help action.","A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves\u2019 tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can\u2019t help another character in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help."],"Group Checks":{content:["When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the GM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren\u2019t.","To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails.","Group checks don\u2019t come up very often, and they\u2019re most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a group Wisdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment.

For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.","Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance.

Temporary hit points aren\u2019t actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury.","When you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage.","Because temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum.

Members of a few classes, including bards and sorcerers, have a limited list of spells they know that are always fixed in mind. The same thing is true of many magic-using monsters. Other spellcasters, such as clerics and wizards, undergo a process of preparing spells.

You can\u2019t cast another spell during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.",Reactions:"Some spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response to some event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so.","Longer Casting Times":"Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your concentration while you do so (see \u201cConcentration\u201d below). If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don\u2019t expend a spell slot. If you want to try casting the spell again, you must start over."},"Spell Range":{content:["The target of a spell must be within the spell\u2019s range. For a spell like *magic missile*, the target is a creature. For a spell like *fireball*, the target is the point in space where the ball of fire erupts.","Most spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some spells can target only a creature (including you) that you touch. Other spells, such as the *shield* spell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self.","Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin point of the spell\u2019s effect must be you (see \u201cAreas of Effect\u201d later in the this chapter).","Once a spell is cast, its effects aren\u2019t limited by its range, unless the spell\u2019s description says otherwise."]},Components:{content:"A spell\u2019s components are the physical requirements you must meet in order to cast it. Each spell\u2019s description indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If you can\u2019t provide one or more of a spell\u2019s components, you are unable to cast the spell.","Verbal (V)":"Most spells require the chanting of mystic words. The words themselves aren\u2019t the source of the spell\u2019s power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area of silence, such as one created by the *silence* spell, can\u2019t cast a spell with a verbal component.","Somatic (S)":"Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a somatic component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures.","Material (M)":{content:["Casting some spells requires particular objects, specified in parentheses in the component entry. A character can use a **component pouch** or a **spellcasting focus** (found in \u201cEquipment\u201d) in place of the components specified for a spell. But if a cost is indicated for a component, a character must have that specific component before he or she can cast the spell.","If a spell states that a material component is consumed by the spell, the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell.","A spellcaster must have a hand free to access a spell\u2019s material components\u2014or to hold a spellcasting focus\u2014but it can be the same hand that he or she uses to perform somatic components."]}},Duration:{content:"A spell\u2019s duration is the length of time the spell persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some spells specify that their effects last until the spells are dispelled or destroyed.",Instantaneous:"Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can\u2019t be dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant.",Concentration:{content:["Some spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends.","If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).","Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn\u2019t interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:",["**Casting another spell that requires concentration.** You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration. You can\u2019t concentrate on two spells at once.","**Taking damage.** Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon\u2019s breath, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.","**Being incapacitated or killed.** You lose concentration on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die."],"The GM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you\u2019re on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell."]}},Targets:{content:["A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected by the spell\u2019s magic. A spell\u2019s description tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect (described below).","Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not know it was targeted by a spell at all. An effect like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a creature\u2019s thoughts, typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise."],"A Clear Path to the Target":{content:["To target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can\u2019t be behind total cover.","If you place an area of effect at a point that you can\u2019t see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction."]},"Targeting Yourself":"If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of a spell you cast, you can target yourself."},"Areas of Effect":{content:["Spells such as *burning hands* and *cone of cold* cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.","A spell\u2019s description specifies its area of effect, which typically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a **point of origin**, a location from which the spell\u2019s energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how you position its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in space, but some spells have an area whose origin is a creature or an object.","A spell\u2019s effect expands in straight lines from the point of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the point of origin to a location within the area of effect, that location isn\u2019t included in the spell\u2019s area. To block one of these imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total cover."],Cone:{content:["A cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A cone\u2019s width at a given point along its length is equal to that point\u2019s distance from the point of origin. A cone\u2019s area of effect specifies its maximum length.","A cone\u2019s point of origin is not included in the cone\u2019s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise."]},Cube:{content:["You select a cube\u2019s point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The cube\u2019s size is expressed as the length of each side.","A cube\u2019s point of origin is not included in the cube\u2019s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise."]},Cylinder:{content:["A cylinder\u2019s point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius, as given in the spell description. The circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the spell effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell\u2019s effect then shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder.","A cylinder\u2019s point of origin is included in the cylinder\u2019s area of effect."]},Line:{content:["A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width.","A line\u2019s point of origin is not included in the line\u2019s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise."]},Sphere:{content:["You select a sphere\u2019s point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that point. The sphere\u2019s size is expressed as a radius in feet that extends from the point.","A sphere\u2019s point of origin is included in the sphere\u2019s area of effect."]}},"Spell Saving Throws":{content:["Many spells specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell\u2019s effects. The spell specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure.","The DC to resist one of your spells equals 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers."]},"Spell Attack Rolls":{content:["Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell effect hits the intended target. Your attack bonus with a spell attack equals your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.","Most spells that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature that can see you and that isn\u2019t incapacitated."]},"Combining Magical Effects":{content:["The effects of different spells add together while the durations of those spells overlap. The effects of the same spell cast multiple times don\u2019t combine, however. Instead, the most potent effect\u2014such as the highest bonus\u2014from those castings applies while their durations overlap.","For example, if two clerics cast *bless* on the same target, that character gains the spell\u2019s benefit only once; he or she doesn\u2019t get to roll two bonus dice."]},"The Schools of Magic":{content:["Academies of magic group spells into eight categories called schools of magic. Scholars, particularly wizards, apply these categories to all spells, believing that all magic functions in essentially the same way, whether it derives from rigorous study or is bestowed by a deity.","The schools of magic help describe spells; they have no rules of their own, although some rules refer to the schools.","**Abjuration** spells are protective in nature, though some of them have aggressive uses. They create magical barriers, negate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish creatures to other planes of existence.","**Conjuration** spells involve the transportation of objects and creatures from one location to another. Some spells summon creatures or objects to the caster\u2019s side, whereas others allow the caster to teleport to another location. Some conjurations create objects or effects out of nothing.","**Divination** spells reveal information, whether in the form of secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the locations of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of distant people or places.","**Enchantment** spells affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior. Such spells can make enemies see the caster as a friend, force creatures to take a course of action, or even control another creature like a puppet.","**Evocation** spells manipulate magical energy to produce a desired effect. Some call up blasts of fire or lightning. Others channel positive energy to heal wounds.","**Illusion** spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They cause people to see things that are not there, to miss things that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember things that never happened. Some illusions create phantom images that any creature can see, but the most insidious illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature.","**Necromancy** spells manipulate the energies of life and death. Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force, drain the life energy from another creature, create the undead, or even bring the dead back to life.","Creating the undead through the use of necromancy spells such as *animate dead* is not a good act, and only evil casters use such spells frequently.","**Transmutation** spells change the properties of a creature, object, or environment. They might turn an enemy into a harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, make an object move at the caster\u2019s command, or enhance a creature\u2019s innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injury."]}},"Spell Lists":{"Bard Spells":{"Cantrips (0 Level)":["Dancing Lights","Light","Mage Hand","Mending","Message","Minor Illusion","Prestidigitation","True Strike"],"1st

In a fantasy game, unwary adventurers can fall to their deaths, be burned alive, or fall under a fusillade of poisoned darts.","A trap can be either mechanical or magical in nature. **Mechanical traps** include pits, arrow traps, falling blocks, water-filled rooms, whirling blades, and anything else that depends on a mechanism to operate. **Magic traps** are either magical device traps or spell traps. Magical device traps initiate spell effects when activated. Spell traps are spells such as *glyph of warding* and *symbol* that function as traps."],"Traps in Play":{content:"When adventurers come across a trap, you need to know how the trap is triggered and what it does, as well as the possibility for the characters to detect the trap and to disable or avoid it.","Triggering a Trap":"Most traps are triggered when a creature goes somewhere or touches something that the trap\u2019s creator wanted to protect. Common triggers include stepping on a pressure plate or a false section of floor, pulling a trip wire, turning a doorknob, and using the wrong key in a lock. Magic traps are often set to go off when a creature enters an area or touches an object. Some magic traps (such as the *glyph of warding* spell) have more complicated trigger conditions, including a password that prevents the trap from activating.","Detecting and Disabling a Trap":{content:["Usually, some element of a trap is visible to careful inspection. Characters might notice an uneven flagstone that conceals a pressure plate, spot the gleam of light off a trip wire, notice small holes in the walls from which jets of flame will erupt, or otherwise detect something that points to a trap\u2019s presence.","A trap\u2019s description specifies the checks and DCs needed to detect it, disable it, or both. A character actively looking for a trap can attempt a Wisdom (Perception) check against the trap\u2019s DC. You can also compare the DC to detect the trap with each character\u2019s passive Wisdom (Perception) score to determine whether anyone in the party notices the trap in passing. If the adventurers detect a trap before triggering it, they might be able to disarm it, either permanently or long enough to move past it. You might call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check for a character to deduce what needs to be done, followed by a Dexterity check using thieves\u2019 tools to perform the necessary sabotage.","Any character can attempt an Intelligence (Arcana) check to detect or disarm a magic trap, in addition to any other checks noted in the trap\u2019s description. The DCs are the same regardless of the check used. In addition, *dispel magic* has a chance of disabling most magic traps. A magic trap\u2019s description provides the DC for the ability check made when you use *dispel magic*.","In most cases, a trap\u2019s description is clear enough that you can adjudicate whether a character\u2019s actions locate or foil the trap. As with many situations, you shouldn\u2019t allow die rolling to override clever play and good planning. Use your common sense, drawing on the trap\u2019s description to determine what happens. No trap\u2019s design can anticipate every possible action that the characters might attempt.","You should allow a character to discover a trap without making an ability check if an action would clearly reveal the trap\u2019s presence. For example, if a character lifts a rug that conceals a pressure plate, the character has found the trigger and no check is required.","Foiling traps can be a little more complicated. Consider a trapped treasure chest. If the chest is opened without first pulling on the two handles set in its sides, a mechanism inside fires a hail of poison needles toward anyone in front of it. After inspecting the chest and making a few checks, the characters are still unsure if it\u2019s trapped. Rather than simply open the chest, they prop a shield in front of it and push the chest open at a distance with an iron rod. In this case, the trap still triggers, but the hail of needles fires harmlessly into the shield.","Traps are often designed with mechanisms that allow them to be disarmed or bypassed. Intelligent monsters that place traps in or around their lairs need ways to get past those traps without harming themselves. Such traps might have hidden levers that disable their triggers, or a secret door might conceal a passage that goes around the trap."]},"Trap Effects":{content:["The effects of traps can range from inconvenient to deadly, making use of elements such as arrows, spikes, blades, poison, toxic gas, blasts of fire, and deep pits. The deadliest traps combine multiple elements to kill, injure, contain, or drive off any creature unfortunate enough to trigger them. A trap\u2019s description specifies what happens when it is triggered.","The attack bonus of a trap, the save DC to resist its effects, and the damage it deals can vary depending on the trap\u2019s severity. Use the Trap Save DCs and Attack Bonuses table and the Damage Severity by Level table for suggestions based on three levels of trap severity.","A trap intended to be a **setback** is unlikely to kill or seriously harm characters of the indicated levels, whereas a **dangerous** trap is likely to seriously injure (and potentially kill) characters of the indicated levels.

It might make successive attacks against intruders, create an effect that changes over time, or otherwise produce a dynamic challenge. Otherwise, the complex trap can be detected and disabled or bypassed in the usual ways.","For example, a trap that causes a room to slowly flood works best as a complex trap.

The pit is usually 10 or 20 feet deep but can be deeper.","Once the pit trap is detected, an iron spike or similar object can be wedged between the pit\u2019s cover and the surrounding floor in such a way as to prevent the cover from opening, thereby making it safe to cross. The cover can also be magically held shut using the *arcane lock* spell or similar magic.","***Locking Pit.*** This pit trap is identical to a hidden pit trap, with one key exception: the trap door that covers the pit is spring-loaded. After a creature falls into the pit, the cover snaps shut to trap its victim inside.","A successful DC 20 Strength check is necessary to pry the cover open. The cover can also be smashed open. A character in the pit can also attempt to disable the spring mechanism from the inside with a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves\u2019 tools, provided that the mechanism can be reached and the character can see. In some cases, a mechanism (usually hidden behind a secret door nearby) opens the pit.","***Spiked Pit.*** This pit trap is a simple, hidden, or locking pit trap with sharpened wooden or iron spikes at the bottom. A creature falling into the pit takes 11 (2d10) piercing damage from the spikes, in addition to any falling damage. Even nastier versions have poison smeared on the spikes.

Many of them have innate magical abilities drawn from the creature\u2019s alien mind rather than the mystical forces of the world. The quintessential aberrations are aboleths, beholders, mind flayers, and slaadi.","**Beasts** are nonhumanoid creatures that are a natural part of the fantasy ecology. Some of them have magical powers, but most are unintelligent and lack any society or language. Beasts include all varieties of ordinary animals, dinosaurs, and giant versions of animals.","**Celestials** are creatures native to the Upper","Planes. Many of them are the servants of deities, employed as messengers or agents in the mortal realm and throughout the planes. Celestials are good by nature, so the exceptional celestial who strays from a good alignment is a horrifying rarity. Celestials include angels, couatls, and pegasi.","**Constructs** are made, not born. Some are programmed by their creators to follow a simple set of instructions, while others are imbued with sentience and capable of independent thought. Golems are the iconic constructs. Many creatures native to the outer plane of Mechanus, such as modrons, are constructs shaped from the raw material of the plane by the will of more powerful creatures.","**Dragons** are large reptilian creatures of ancient origin and tremendous power. True dragons, including the good metallic dragons and the evil chromatic dragons, are highly intelligent and have innate magic. Also in this category are creatures distantly related to true dragons, but less powerful, less intelligent, and less magical, such as wyverns and pseudodragons.","**Elementals** are creatures native to the elemental planes. Some creatures of this type are little more than animate masses of their respective elements, including the creatures simply called elementals. Others have biological forms infused with elemental energy. The races of genies, including djinn and efreet, form the most important civilizations on the elemental planes. Other elemental creatures include azers, invisible stalkers, and water weirds.","**Fey** are magical creatures closely tied to the forces of nature. They dwell in twilight groves and misty forests. In some worlds, they are closely tied to the Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie. Some are also found in the Outer Planes, particularly the planes of Arborea and the Beastlands. Fey include dryads, pixies, and satyrs.","**Fiends** are creatures of wickedness that are native to the Lower Planes. A few are the servants of deities, but many more labor under the leadership of archdevils and demon princes. Evil priests and mages sometimes summon fiends to the material world to do their bidding. If an evil celestial is a rarity, a good fiend is almost inconceivable. Fiends include demons, devils, hell hounds, rakshasas, and yugoloths.","**Giants** tower over humans and their kind. They are humanlike in shape, though some have multiple heads (ettins) or deformities (fomorians). The six varieties of true giant are hill giants, stone giants, frost giants, fire giants, cloud giants, and storm giants. Besides these, creatures such as ogres and trolls are giants.","**Humanoids** are the main peoples of a fantasy gaming world, both civilized and savage, including humans and a tremendous variety of other species. They have language and culture, few if any innate magical abilities (though most humanoids can learn spellcasting), and a bipedal form. The most common humanoid races are the ones most suitable as player characters: humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings. Almost as numerous but far more savage and brutal, and almost uniformly evil, are the races of goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears), orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds.","**Monstrosities** are monsters in the strictest sense\u2014frightening creatures that are not ordinary, not truly natural, and almost never benign. Some are the results of magical experimentation gone awry (such as owlbears), and others are the product of terrible curses (including minotaurs and yuan-ti). They defy categorization, and in some sense serve as a catch-all category for creatures that don\u2019t fit into any other type.","**Oozes** are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a fixed shape. They are mostly subterranean, dwelling in caves and dungeons and feeding on refuse, carrion, or creatures unlucky enough to get in their way. Black puddings and gelatinous cubes are among the most recognizable oozes.","**Plants** in this context are vegetable creatures, not ordinary flora. Most of them are ambulatory, and some are carnivorous. The quintessential plants are the shambling mound and the treant. Fungal creatures such as the gas spore and the myconid also fall into this category.","**Undead** are once-living creatures brought to a horrifying state of undeath through the practice of necromantic magic or some unholy curse. Undead include walking corpses, such as vampires and zombies, as well as bodiless spirits, such as ghosts and specters."],Tags:"A monster might have one or more tags appended to its type, in parentheses. For example, an orc has the *humanoid (orc)* type. The parenthetical tags provide additional categorization for certain creatures.

The four **Elemental Planes**\u2014Air, Earth, Fire, and Water\u2014form a ring around the Material Plane, suspended within the churning **Elemental Chaos**.","At their innermost edges, where they are closest to the Material Plane (in a conceptual if not a literal geographical sense), the four Elemental Planes resemble a world in the Material Plane. The four elements mingle together as they do in the Material Plane, forming land, sea, and sky. Farther from the Material Plane, though, the Elemental Planes are both alien and hostile. Here, the elements exist in their purest form\u2014great expanses of solid earth, blazing fire, crystal-clear water, and unsullied air. These regions are little-known, so when discussing the Plane of Fire, for example, a speaker usually means just the border region. At the farthest extents of the Inner Planes, the pure elements dissolve and bleed together into an unending tumult of clashing energies and colliding substance, the Elemental Chaos."]},"Outer Planes":{content:["If the Inner Planes are the raw matter and energy that makes up the multiverse, the Outer Planes are the direction, thought and purpose for such construction. Accordingly, many sages refer to the Outer Planes as divine planes, spiritual planes, or godly planes, for the Outer Planes are best known as the homes of deities.","When discussing anything to do with deities, the language used must be highly metaphorical. Their actual homes are not literally \u201cplaces\u201d at all, but exemplify the idea that the Outer Planes are realms of thought and spirit. As with the Elemental Planes, one can imagine the perceptible part of the Outer Planes as a sort of border region, while extensive spiritual regions lie beyond ordinary sensory experience.","Even in those perceptible regions, appearances can be deceptive. Initially, many of the Outer Planes appear hospitable and familiar to natives of the Material Plane. But the landscape can change at the whims of the powerful forces that live on the Outer Planes. The desires of the mighty forces that dwell on these planes can remake them completely, effectively erasing and rebuilding existence itself to better fulfill their own needs.","Distance is a virtually meaningless concept on the Outer Planes. The perceptible regions of the planes often seem quite small, but they can also stretch on to what seems like infinity. It might be possible to take a guided tour of the Nine Hells, from the first layer to the ninth, in a single day\u2014if the powers of the Hells desire it. Or it could take weeks for travelers to make a grueling trek across a single layer.","The most well-known Outer Planes are a group of sixteen planes that correspond to the eight alignments (excluding neutrality) and the shades of distinction between them."],"Outer Planes":"The planes with some element of good in their nature are called the **Upper Planes**. Celestial creatures such as angels and pegasi dwell in the Upper Planes. Planes with some element of evil are the **Lower Planes**. Fiends such as demons and devils dwell in the Lower Planes. A plane\u2019s alignment is its essence, and a character whose alignment doesn\u2019t match the plane\u2019s experiences a profound sense of dissonance there. When a good creature visits Elysium, for example (a neutral good Upper Plane), it feels in tune with the plane, but an evil creature feels out of tune and more than a little uncomfortable.",Demiplanes:"Demiplanes are small extradimensional spaces with their own unique rules. They are pieces of reality that don\u2019t seem to fit anywhere else. Demiplanes come into being by a variety of means. Some are created by spells, such as *demiplane,* or generated at the desire of a powerful deity or other force. They may exist naturally, as a fold of existing reality that has been pinched off from the rest of the multiverse, or as a baby universe growing in power. A given demiplane can be entered through a single point where it touches another plane. Theoretically, a *plane shift* spell can also carry travelers to a demiplane, but the proper frequency required for the tuning fork is extremely hard to acquire. The *gate* spell is more reliable, assuming the caster knows of the demiplane."}}},"Appendix MM-A: Miscellaneous Creatures":{content:"This appendix contains statistics for various animals, vermin, and other critters.
